# Sudden-XCVR

These are the EagleCAD schematics and board files for the QRP Transceiver designed and built by Pete Julino N6QW called the Sudden Transceiver.  

I am very new to building a truly scratch built rig, so any suggestions, comments, corrections are greatly appreciated.

I use a style of construction coined by Chuck Adams K7QO called 'Muppet Style', you can learn about this style of building from Chuck's YouTube channel

As I progress along I'll be adding PDF of the schematics and boards as well as the EagleCAD parts library I use.
