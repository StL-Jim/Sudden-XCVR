# Sudden-XCVR

These are the EagleCAD schematics and board files for the QRP Transceiver designed and built by Pete Julino called the Sudden Transceiver.  

I am very new to building a truely scratch built rig, so any suggestions, comments, corrections are greatly appreciated.

You can read all about the Transciver

I use a style of construction coined by Chuck Adams K7QO called 'Muppet Style', you can learn about this style of building from Chuck's Youtube channel

As I progess along I'll be adding PDF of the schematics and boards as well as the EagleCAD parts library I use.
